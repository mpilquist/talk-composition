== Outline (Delete Me)

- Intro
  - What is composition?
  - Why is it important?
  - "Pure" functional programming & referential transparency
- Tour of techniques
  - Data modeling & immutability via ip4s
  - Error handling via Try
  - Combinators via scodec
  - Invention (courage to create) via skunk lru cache
  - Typeclasses via monoids

 
Parking lot:
- 7+-2
- Thinking fast and slow
- Inventing on principle
- Constraints liberate
- Courage to create
- skunk and lru cache
- ip4s and immutability
- persistent data structures and ADTs
- modeling computation failures
- scodec & combinators
- type classes

== Complexity

=== Complexity

"Complexity is the root cause of the vast majority of problems with software today. Unreliability, late delivery, lack of security -- often even poor performance in large-scale systems can all be seen as deriving ultimately from unmanageable complexity."
-- Ben Moseley & Peter Marks, Out of the Tar Pit. 2006

=== Complexity

"...we have to keep it crisp, disentangled, and simple if we refuse to be crushed by the complexities of our own making..."
-- Edgar Dijkstra, The Tide, Not the Waves. 1997

=== Complexity

"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are _obviously_ no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no _obvious_ deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult."
-- C.A.R. Hoare, The Emperor's Old Clothes (Turing Award Lecture). 1980

=== Complexity

"It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature."
-- C.A.R. Hoare, The Emperor's Old Clothes (Turing Award Lecture). 1980
